# Magnus Effect - The Physics of Football. 
## Abstract
Often in the field of sports, we see examples of curveballs swerving their way around players and following an interesting curved trajectory. 
This happens because of the Magnus Effect, which relies on the spin of the ball and drag force to generate areas of high and low pressure, which results in such a path. 
In this project, we have explained and demonstrated this effect with real-life examples from football and followed them up with a simulation and graphical analysis in Python. We have compared the graphs generated from an ideal situation developed in a python simulation with a real-life example tracked on the Tracker software. 

Keywords: Magnus Effect, football, python, simulation, curved path, spin, drag force, air pressure, Bernoulliâ€™s Principle

## Results from the simulations
